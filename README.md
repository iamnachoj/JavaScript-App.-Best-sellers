# JavaScript-App. Pok√©dex

List and details of Pokemon provided by an external API (https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/?limit=150).

Tech stack: the basic trio Html-CSS-JavaScript + bootstrap (specially in the use of modals). 

I put into practice Modals, data extraction from external API (parsing JSON), use of technical CSS properties, IIFEs, Asynchronous code.
