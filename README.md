# JavaScript-App. Pok√©dex

The Objective of this project is to build a small web application with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that loads data from an external API and enables the viewing of data points (pokemons, of course) in detail. In addition to that, I use Bootstrap to perform several UI patterns such as Modals. 

As soon as you open the site, you should be able to view a clean, minimal list of the API data (pokemon names), displayed in buttons that can be clicked to see more details and an image of each of the pokemon. 

The App is full responsive and enabled in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, and Internet Explorer 11.

List and details of Pokemon provided by an external API (https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/?limit=150).

Tech stack: the basic trio Html-CSS-JavaScript + bootstrap (specially in the use of modals). 

ESlint rules can be found in the .eslintc file

In order to find the full code files, you will need to go to the file SRC. Index.html is linked to the scripts and styles.css via the DIST file, which are the same but minified files.

I put into practice Modals, data extraction from external API (parsing JSON), use of technical CSS properties, IIFEs, Asynchronous code.
